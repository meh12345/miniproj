Prisoner
enigmatic
sea
standing
alone
upon
rocky
shore
Once
illuminated
horizons
now
abandoned
watches
waves
roar
Powerful
winds
influence
current
as
atmosphere
perspires
salty
air
In
conjunction
ocean
joins
storm
raging
tides
dance
with
malevolent
flair
Tempest
terrorizes
with
wild
fury
flooding
lands
demolishing
weak
buildings
Animals
suffer
with
fishermen
lost
storm
leaves
behind
aftermath
killings
Standing
tall
through
this
barbaric
onslaught
unscathed
lighthouse
combated
harm
Replaced
modern
day
technology
deserted
forgotten
lost
