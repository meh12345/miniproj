Sometimes we have to say goodbye
leave the past behind and move on
It's natural to have a cry
don't live with regret when it's gone
Leave the past behind and move on
New dreams lie ahead keep the hope
don't live with regret when it's gone
The whole universe is your scope
New dreams lie ahead keep the hope
Your heart will love again my friend
the whole universe is your scope
It's the beginning, not the end
Your heart will love again my friend
It's natural to have a cry
It's the beginning not the end
Sometimes we have to say goodbye
