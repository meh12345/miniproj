As Good As Me
Why would we want to raise a lot of fuss
Trying to find out what was analogous
To a bird they had found in my brain
Having a heard that was hard to explain
Just how hard can a head possibly be
Heard hard ones exist in high society
Who to group later became a traitor
Going to government as a Senator
Maybe might have been a Representative
And with a long laundry list they live
I became part of a bunch of old cadgers
Some say my poems sound like Will Rogers
Many words for more poems I now need
So prayed to the Lord for Him to feed
Me poems from place where they were lost
Sounding kind of similar to Bobert Frost
Then that night after I deliberately did crash
In a dream appeared a poem by Ogden Nash
Was so thrilled by trilogy of those three
Such a shame they weren't as good as me
