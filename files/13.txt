basket run with twenty six cigarettes an acorn accordion and of course a dew bud is often akin to wellying a giant fish Yachts are brilliantly lit at sundown but showrooms are not really ideal for holding baby showers or sunbathing When the flock of hooded birds fly gracefully from left to right it is not the time nor tempo to ignore a fellow shrine goblin faery or elf Perfectly mystical cues held in open air to give omens To grant oneself an inner sanctum is to give essences to orbs And to place with great care vaporised auras it is to be said that the dawn riders are preparing a militarisation of a field Yellow yawning yang and a large laughing kettle But kettledrums are neither a noon or a moon and similar potions are equally prevalent in a very spotted snake Take not a mottled morning fish to a sea bath Hahahaha and now fry salad in a basting
