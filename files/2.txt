A wonderful day in this town
Ephemeral efflorescence all around
The pervasive propinquity of dark clouds
The harbinger of rains
Accompanied by the petrichor
I have an epiphany
Redolent of our erstwhile demesne
We had had by sheer serendipity
It would bring us very often
Similar beautifully bucolic moments
Of dalliance and delight
