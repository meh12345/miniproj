One might question you dear water nymph
For thinking that a man you could own
And still expecting love to triumph
Indeed I find it a hard action to atone
But everyone in isolation fails
And I cannot cast the first stone
For how many ships have passed with fluttering sails
Those white blankets traipsing with the gust
Over mizzen mast and gunwales
The goddess watching with enflamed lust
on the edge of her jetty shore
As the mariners are carried away with the wind’s every thrust
Knowing eventually the ship will be no more
While on the land she must stay
Made her clamber for the mariners all the more
I have similar words to convey
For there have been many ships that have left me behind
I’ve grasped the water and it floated away
I urge you goddess put off your daily grind
Take a second to contemplate
For in the things you have peace you will find
None other can claim your Aegean real estate
It’s location any would admire
Let not your emotions deflate
Rattle your tambourine and play your lyre
Sing and dance for your given lot
Light the cathartic bonfire
Fret not, for what you have not
Your treasures none could curtail
But the ships in time will be forgot
