Tall poplars cast shadow
Upon a beautiful meadow
The smell of marigold awakens the soul
Green eyes of spring are in control
Crocuses will peep from beneath the snow
Through the boughs of trees the wind will blow
The primrose appear from below
Everything begins to grow
Hills roll
About that roll
There is something causing ache of the soul
Similar like the one world feels late fall
The hills roll for infinity
Above them buzzard flies with majesty
At one moment you feel time catching up to you
At others you feel like it has stopped to
The river snakes through the scene
The scene is so serene
You feel there is freedom there that you canâ€™t touch
And that hurts your spirit very much
But it is natural to be free
This is your destiny
The two paradoxes are for now untouchable but real
And when reaching blue omega truly free you will feel
