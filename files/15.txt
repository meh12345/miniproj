Are you anxious in making mistakes 
Do you feel terrible when you do
Mistakes are simply outcomes we did not expect and can lead
to growth
Start by admitting your mistakes
You can only learn from a mistake if you admit you made one
As you start blaming other people
You miss out any possible lesson
Admit error even if it is only for yourself takes the focus from assigning blame
Moves you toward understanding

Talking to someone else about what happened gives you the benefit of your friend’s experience 
He or she may have made similar mistake or know how to deal with it
In addition
Describing the event forces you to think it through
May even help you see opportunities you didn’t know were there
Decide to change
Ask What will I do better next time
Real growth or development and change happen when you see improvement
Then commit in making necessary changes to avoid the mistake in the
future
Benefit from mistakes
The most important lesson to remember
If you learn from the current mistake
You may be able to avoid a future one
Making a mistake does not make you a mistake
Remember Eternal God is the only one you know who does not make them
