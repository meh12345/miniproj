Perhaps in some part of each lifetime
we were and are each of us a poet
separate yet inexplicably similar
breathing in and seeing living as it is 
both pure and innocent
despite the evil and difficulties around us
Filled and overwhelmed by feelings and emotions
we embrace the wonders of life
and for the moment see its  beauty in words
and express them in the moment of inspiration
When your moment comes
hold it close to your heart
gather your pen and paper
and be a poet
