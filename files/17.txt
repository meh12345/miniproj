Playing with words in unusual ways
Agony inducing puns and bon mots
Reality bending restructurings of meanings
Oblectation experienced with verbal gymnastics
Nonsensical poesy concealing true meaning
Odditorium of meanings now open for business
Mangled grammatical structures tottering in the breeze
Auxesis demonstrated for melodramatic effect
Symphilism of phraseology achieved synergistically
Iconism fashioned from commonplace pedestrianism
Abditive absurdities revealed in shadowy obscurities
