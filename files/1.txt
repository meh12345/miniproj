Prisoner of the enigmatic sea
standing alone upon the rocky shore
Once it illuminated the horizons
now abandoned it watches as waves roar
Powerful winds influence the current
as the as atmosphere perspires salty air
In conjunction the ocean as joins the storm
raging tides dance with malevolent flair
Tempest terrorizes with wild fury
flooding lands demolishing weak buildings
Animals suffer with fishermen lost
storm leaves behind an aftermath of killings
Standing tall through this barbaric onslaught
unscathed the lighthouse combated all harm
Replaced by modern day technology
deserted forgotten but not lost its charm
