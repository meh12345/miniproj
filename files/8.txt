Each of us differ in beliefs
If there’s heaven or hell
If there’s life after death
If there’s a God at the end
What if a test paper is laid?
Before you sleep your final rest
To prove what you’ve done right
To know what you’ve done wrong
A simple reply of true or false
Similar to a lie detector test
A check for all you’ve done right
But every truth shall affect the lies
Most of us will surely fail
Not for the right minus wrong
But more on the wrong minus right
Since we are just human after all
For here on earth is different
Material things are given weight
Wealthy people are much revered
No matter how they got their hoard
They say, ask and you shall receive
They say, give and you will be blessed
But rich people don’t ask they take
And they don’t give but are plain fortunate
So where did it leave the poor
They work harder in order to receive
Don’t steal to get what they need
They want to help have none to give
There’s no need for labeling
Evil is evil wrong is wrong
Regardless of how often you do
Notwithstanding how grave you sin
