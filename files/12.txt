Christmas me in my red wagon
Slogging in tears later you forget
Am I a full person
Blown black pepper stings your eyes
You strike me the ambivalence aches
Covered mouth laugh-sharing from now on
Reattached you escape childish dreams
I offer to banish parts of me
Warriors on the horizon plump and ascending
You appear similar soul less smaller
I scurry looking for your parts
I miss them
At your escape hatch I make room
I hide in your obscurity
Broken in all endeavors
Waiting in luxurious swamps
Enmeshment preventing loneliness
I wanted to hurt you too
