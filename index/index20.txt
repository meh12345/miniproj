Shortly
studying
consciousness
years
It
dawned
why
going
with
grandfather
to
clean
pasture
spring
was
such
strong
memory
grandfather
tossing
hat
branch
kneels
As
I
watched
brown
leaves
small
limbs
cleaned
I
dimly
understood
that
this
was
kind
truth
which
I
finally
realized
years
ago
Cleaning
spring
I
felt
was
similar
to
clearing
detritus
consciousness
to
experience
