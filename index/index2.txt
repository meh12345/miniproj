One
might
question
you
dear
water
nymph
For
thinking
that
man
you
own
And
still
expecting
love
to
triumph
Indeed
I
find
hard
action
to
atone
But
everyone
isolation
fails
And
I
cast
first
stone
For
many
ships
passed
with
fluttering
sails
Those
white
blankets
traipsing
with
gust
Over
mizzen
mast
gunwales
The
goddess
watching
with
enflamed
lust
on
edge
jetty
shore
As
mariners
carried
away
with
wind’s
every
thrust
Knowing
eventually
ship
will
more
While
land
must
stay
Made
clamber
mariners
more
I
similar
words
to
convey
For
there
many
ships
that
left
behind
I’ve
grasped
water
floated
away
I
urge
you
goddess
put
your
daily
grind
Take
second
to
contemplate
For
things
you
peace
you
will
find
None
can
claim
your
Aegean
real
estate
It’s
location
would
admire
Let
your
emotions
deflate
Rattle
your
tambourine
play
your
lyre
Sing
dance
your
given
lot
Light
cathartic
bonfire
Fret
not,
what
you
not
Your
treasures
none
curtail
But
ships
time
will
