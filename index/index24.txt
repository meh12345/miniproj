Tall
poplars
cast
shadow
Upon
beautiful
meadow
The
smell
marigold
awakens
soul
Green
eyes
spring
control
Crocuses
will
peep
beneath
snow
Through
boughs
trees
wind
will
blow
The
primrose
appear
below
Everything
begins
to
grow
Hills
roll
About
that
roll
There
something
causing
ache
soul
Similar
like
one
world
feels
late
fall
The
hills
roll
infinity
Above
them
buzzard
flies
with
majesty
At
one
moment
you
feel
time
catching
up
to
you
At
others
you
feel
like
stopped
to
The
river
snakes
through
scene
The
scene
so
serene
You
feel
there
freedom
there
that
you
canâ€™t
touch
And
that
hurts
your
spirit
very
much
But
natural
to
free
This
your
destiny
The
two
paradoxes
now
untouchable
real
And
when
reaching
blue
omega
truly
free
you
will
