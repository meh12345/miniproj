Each
us
differ
beliefs
If
there’s
heaven
hell
If
there’s
life
death
If
there’s
God
end
What
test
paper
laid?
Before
you
sleep
your
final
rest
To
prove
what
you’ve
done
right
To
know
what
you’ve
done
wrong
A
simple
reply
true
false
Similar
to
lie
detector
test
A
check
you’ve
done
right
But
every
truth
shall
affect
lies
Most
us
will
surely
fail
Not
right
minus
wrong
But
wrong
minus
right
Since
we
just
human
all
For
earth
different
Material
things
given
weight
Wealthy
people
much
revered
No
matter
they
got
their
hoard
They
say,
ask
you
shall
receive
They
say,
give
you
will
blessed
But
rich
people
don’t
ask
they
take
And
they
don’t
give
plain
fortunate
So
where
leave
poor
They
work
harder
order
to
receive
Don’t
steal
to
get
what
they
need
They
want
to
help
none
to
give
There’s
need
labeling
Evil
evil
wrong
wrong
Regardless
often
you
do
Notwithstanding
grave
you
