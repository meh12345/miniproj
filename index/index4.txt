Christmas
red
wagon
Slogging
tears
later
you
forget
Am
I
full
person
Blown
black
pepper
stings
your
eyes
You
strike
ambivalence
aches
Covered
mouth
laugh-sharing
now
on
Reattached
you
escape
childish
dreams
I
offer
to
banish
parts
me
Warriors
horizon
plump
ascending
You
appear
similar
soul
less
smaller
I
scurry
looking
your
parts
I
miss
them
At
your
escape
hatch
I
make
room
I
hide
your
obscurity
Broken
endeavors
Waiting
luxurious
swamps
Enmeshment
preventing
loneliness
I
wanted
to
hurt
you
